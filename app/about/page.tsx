              Why We Started
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              The idea for <span className="font-bold">PeakSummit</span> was born from the frustration many climbers experience when choosing the right climbing shoes. With so many options on the market, it's often difficult to know which shoe is the best fit for your specific needs. Our goal is to simplify the process and offer personalized recommendations to ensure that every climber, from beginner to expert, can find their perfect match.
